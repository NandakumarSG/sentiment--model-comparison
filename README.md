# Sentiment Model Comparison
This project is to compare the F1 scores on performing sentiment analysis on reviews. The data is obtained from the yelp data set.

The models that will be compared are the Multinomial Naive Bayes model and the Support Vector Machine. We will be making a comparison between the CountVectorizer and TfIdfVectorizer too.

In order to get faster output and to predict the expected outcome, a smaller datset was used.
